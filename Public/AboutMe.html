    <p>I am Rea Balagosa Letania, 19 years old. My birthday is on <a href="./Birthday Cake.html">November 10, 2006.</a> <br/>
        I am currently studying at Western Mindanao State University (ESU-IPIL) with the course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. <br/>
       I graduated at San Isidro National High Schoo where I have have a lot of good and bad memories. When I was Grade 12, I've decided that I <br/>
        will not continue my study because of financial problem but my classmate encourage me to submit a requirements for College Entrance Test (CET) <br/>
        and I asked permission first to my  mother and go with my classmates and that is for only experience. I did not expect that I will pass the <br/>
        exam. Here I am continuing my college journey for better future. My mama said, "It is better to suffer for 4 years in college than suffer in <br/>
        your remaining life". 
    </p>
    <p>My hobby is a little bit messy because I'm kinda moody and I will do what I think depends on my body since I am a lazy lady. Sometimes I love <br/>
         playing different sports like basketball, volleyball and usually I sleep in my vacant time. I am an energetic person.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my family, I am the laziest younger daughter. My Mother's name is Liberty Borlado Balagosa and My deceased Father is Reynante Reponte Letania. <br/>
        I have seven siblings namely Madelyn and Dexter-they are my step sibling and Beth, Erwin, Elaine, Leah, Edzel-my siblings in my father. <br/>
        When I was 11 years old and I am in Grade 6, my life change in very sad way, I lost my dad. It was one of the most painful moments in my life. <br/>
        I was still young and did not fully understand why things like that happpen. I cried a lot during that moment because I love my father a lot <br/>
        and he is the man in my life. I missed him very much until now. Despite to the tragedy, a lot of people helped. Even though it was a sad memory, <br/>
        it made me stronger. It taught me to value my family  more and to be brave even when life is difficult. I carry the love and memories of my late <br/>
        father in my heart as I continue to grow and follow what my heart wants (dreams).
